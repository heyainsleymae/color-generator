A simple, full-window color generator that gets out of the way.

## About

I love colors, and building this color generator allowed me to flex my React and Redux muscles while creating something that brings me joy. It generates random color codes in both hexadecimal and RGB, with options for full-spectrum or grayscale color pools. A color history panel allows for viewing of all previously generated colors.

## Accessibility and Improvements

Accessibility is the bedrock of any well-designed application, and every effort has been made to meet Level AAA of W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). If you notice any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, [create an issue](https://github.com/thejohnrt/color-generator/issues); I'd love to hear your feedback!
