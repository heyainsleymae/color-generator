A simple, full-window color generator that gets out of the way.

## About

Once upon a time, this project was a demonstration of my React skills. I don't like React now—did I ever?—so I'm refactoring it to use vanilla JavaScript instead. It's also an opportunity to get some practice with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and use [Color.js](https://colorjs.io).

## Accessibility and Improvements

*This commit may not be accessible; I need to do more research on `aria-atomic` and the live region implementation in `<output>` elements to decrease the verbosity of the color history.*

Accessibility is the bedrock of any well-designed application, and every effort has been made to meet Level AAA of W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). If you notice any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, [create an issue](https://github.com/thejohnrt/color-generator/issues); I'd love to hear your feedback!
